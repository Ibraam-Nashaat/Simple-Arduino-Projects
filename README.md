# Simple-Arduino-Projects
- This repository includes the code of simple Arduino projects.
## Projects: 
### 1. BlinkingLED :
- This project aims at blinking a LED using a pushbutton by clicking the button once to turn it on and clicking the button again to turn it off. This code makes use of the debouncing effect of the pushbutton to achieve this functionality.
